# Color Flipper project in javascript

   Just a fun project of an color flipper website using mostly javascript to do the magic.
   In this project you can use the index.html to a simple version, or you can use the hex.html to a most complex version, but they're similar. 
   The index.html points to app.js
   The hex.html points to hex.js
